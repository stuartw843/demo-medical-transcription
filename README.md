# Medical Transcription Assistant

A real-time medical transcription and AI-powered SOAP note generation demo application. This has been vibe coded to demo what can be possible and it's not recommended to use in production. This is to demonstrate the low-latency real-time transcription from Speechmatics. This system transcribes doctor-patient consultations in real-time and automatically generates structured medical notes following the SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format. Then demonstrates using real-time transcription for dictation. It includes some basic commands.

   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
   ```env
   SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY=your_speechmatics_api_key_here
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   PORT=3001
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```bash
   # In a new terminal, from the root directory
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Allow microphone access when prompted

## Configuration

### API Keys Setup

#### Speechmatics API
1. Sign up at [Speechmatics](https://www.speechmatics.com/)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file as `SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY`

#### OpenAI API
1. Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file as `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Audio Setup
- Ensure your microphone is working and permissions are granted
- Select the appropriate audio input device from the dropdown
- Test with sample consultations before live use

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in environment variables (not committed to version control)
- OpenAI API calls include `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` - consider server-side proxy for production
- Audio data is processed in real-time and not permanently stored
- WebSocket connections are CORS-protected

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# Build frontend
npm run build

# Build backend
cd server
npm run build
```

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

### Environment Variables for Production
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- Configure proper CORS origins
- Use HTTPS for secure audio capture
- Consider rate limiting for API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Audio not working**
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- Ensure audio device is selected and working
- Try refreshing the page

**Transcription not appearing**
- Verify Speechmatics API key is correct
- Check network connectivity
- Look for error messages in browser console

**AI analysis failing**
